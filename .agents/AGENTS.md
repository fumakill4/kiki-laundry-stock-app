# Project Development Rules & Checklists

To prevent integration oversights and ensure seamless setups in future projects, the following rules and checks must be applied:

## 1. Firebase & Google Cloud Server-Side Verification
* **Never assume the Firebase/Cloud database is initialized**: Even if `google-services.json` is present in the project, always ask the user to verify if the Firestore Database instance has been initialized in the Firebase Console. If not, initialize it with the reviewed authorization rules; never enable public read/write access to make synchronization succeed.
* **Google Drive API Status**: If the app features Google Drive backups, explicitly instruct the user to enable the **Google Drive API** in the Google Cloud Console for the active project.
* **OAuth consent screen Publishing Status**:
  * For development and testing of Google Sign-in and Google Drive integration, ensure the project's OAuth publishing status is set to **"Testing"** in Google Cloud Console.
  * In the **"Audience"** tab of the new Google Auth Platform, ensure all tester emails (e.g., family members or QA testers) are added to the **"Test users"** list.

## 2. Android Google OAuth Recovery Flow (User Permission Grants)
* **Handle `UserRecoverableAuthException`**: When retrieving Google OAuth 2.0 access tokens on Android using `GoogleAuthUtil.getToken(context, account, scope)`, always catch `com.google.android.gms.auth.UserRecoverableAuthException` separately.
* **Launch Permission Recovery Intent**: Never log this exception as a simple string error. You must extract `e.intent` and pass it to the UI (Activity or Compose screen) to be launched using `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` or `startActivityForResult`. This forces the device to pop up the Google consent dialog, allowing the user to grant permission (e.g., for Google Drive access).
* **Verify Scopes**: Always verify if the user granted the required scope during the Google Sign-in flow. If not, request the permission explicitly.

## 3. Storage Permission Architecture
* **Local Storage (Android SAF)**: Requires the user to manually select a directory using a folder picker due to Android's Scoped Storage security model.
* **Cloud Storage (Google Drive API)**: Does not require manual folder picker UI. Using the `drive.file` scope allows the app to automatically create its own folder and manage its files securely, provided that the OAuth consent has been granted.

## 4. Build Compilation & Project Folder Isolation
* **Incremental Versioning**: Every time you compile a new APK/AAB, you MUST increment the version number in the Gradle configuration (both `versionName` and `versionCode`). Do not reuse version numbers for different builds.
* **Folder Isolation**: Keep laundry files and Toko Queensha files completely separated.
  * Laundry app deliverables (APK, AAB, `.md` reports) must only go to `~/workspace/Downloads/JCL KIKI/`.
  * Toko Queensha app deliverables must only go to `~/workspace/Downloads/Toko Queensha/`.
  * Never copy or build laundry apps into the Toko Queensha folder or vice versa.
* **Safe Deletions**: Always double-check absolute file paths before calling delete or remove commands to avoid accidentally deleting other projects' files or documentation.

## 5. In-Code Digital Signature
* **Insert Digital Signature**: Always insert the digital signature comment or constant in the code: `"This App was build by i729 - Fumakill4"`.
* **Placement**: This signature must be placed inside the codebase (e.g., in a code comment, String constant, or internal metadata initialization), not in any user-facing UI screens. This ensures that when the APK is decompiled or inspected, the signature remains visible.

## 6. Network Timeouts & Resiliency (Preventing App Hangs)
* **OkHttpClient Timeouts**: Never use infinite or default timeouts for OkHttpClient or network operations. Always configure connection, read, and write timeouts (e.g., 15 seconds) explicitly.
* **Graceful Failures**: If network calls or Google Drive folder creation fail (due to disabled APIs or poor connection), propagate the error immediately and show a Toast/Dialog. Never allow the app to hang indefinitely at any progress level (e.g., stuck at 80%).

## 7. Navigation & Button Integrity
* **No Empty Event Handlers**: Ensure all navigation triggers (e.g., "Lihat semua" lists) and actions (save, edit, delete, backup buttons) have fully implemented event handlers. Empty onClick bodies `{ }` are unacceptable.
